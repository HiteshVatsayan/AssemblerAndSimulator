Overview: This project involves the development of two critical components: an Assembler and a Simulator for an assembly language. The Assembler translates human-readable assembly code into machine code, while the Simulator executes the generated machine code. These components are implemented in Python.
Tech Stack:
 Programming Language: Python
Assembler Features:
 Support for all specified assembly instructions.
 Handling of labels, variables, and variable definitions.
 Robust error handling for various syntax errors.
 Generation of binary output when code is error-free.
Simulator Features:
 Loading binary code into memory and executing from address 0.
 Outputting program counter and register values at each step.
 Displaying a memory dump of the entire memory (256 lines).
Implementation:
 The assembler reads assembly code, performs lexical analysis and parsing, generates machine code, and handles errors.
 The simulator loads binary code, simulates execution, and provides real-time program state information.
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, assembly language translation, and simulation techniques, offering a valuable educational tool for understanding assembly languages and their execution.
